# Hi there, I'm Maurício

I'm a Senior Data Engineer focused on building scalable, resilient, and business-aligned data solutions. My background includes experience in data architecture, back-end development, and project leadership across multiple industries.

A bit about me:
 - I'm currently a Senior Data Engineer at [Creditas](https://www.creditas.com/).
 - I hold a specialization in Data Architecture from Pontifícia Universidade Católica de Minas Gerais (PUC-MG) and a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration from Universidade de Brascubas.
 - I used to be a Graphic Designer and have a deep love for illustration and pixel art.
 - I'm a huge video game fan and an active member of the game modding community, where I combine my art and programming skills to bring fascinating ideas to life.

Throughout my career, I've had brief experiences or collaborated closely in areas such as back-end development, data analysis, solution architecture, project management, and UX research. These exposures have contributed to a broader understanding of software development and reinforced the value of effective collaboration and communication across teams.

My experiences include:
 - Architecting and implementing data solutions in the Cloud, primarily using AWS.
 - Recruiting data professionals for platform, data engineering, and data analysis teams.
 - Managing data projects from conception to delivery, utilizing best software engineering practices.
 - Developing web services and applications with Python and Node.js.

Instead of listing the tools I know, which can change frequently, I prefer to highlight the concepts and practices that I believe are essential for a good data engineer:
 - Understanding data architectures and their alignment with business needs
 - Documenting and sharing knowledge effectively
 - Collaborating and communicating well within a team, especially with cross-functional teams
 - Understanding database design and modeling
 - Developing resilient and scalable ETLs and data pipelines
 - Handling real-time and batch data ingestion
 - Proficiency in SQL and NoSQL databases, such as Graph and Document databases
 - Building event-driven or idempotent orchestrated data pipelines
 - Applying best software engineering practices in data projects
 - Considering user experience, even for internal projects
 - Implementing data contracts correctly to ensure data quality and integrity
 - Monitoring and observing data pipelines effectively
 - Managing sensitive data and ensuring data security and privacy
 - Defining and enforcing data retention and access policies
